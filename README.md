# 2020: A Space Odyssey

This was a class-long project of 3 people, spanning around 8 weeks, right after quarantine began.

## Creating a game physics engine
Utilized C programming language to create a game physics engine from scratch: began with vectors, vector lists, then moved to polygons, bodies, collisions, and forces. Games and demos were created with the physics engine and SDL2.0.

Demos: ball bounce, gravity, springs, Breakout, Pacman, Space Invaders, and more.

## Space Odyssey Game
The game code is found in [/demo/game.c](https://github.com/vactorious/2020-a-space-odyssey/blob/master/demo/game.c)

Using our created physics engine, we created a pseudo-3D space game by simulating three-dimensional perspective with polygon size and velocity. Sounds and text were implemented, as well as various collisions and forces.
